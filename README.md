## 👋 About

This project was my first time FULLY vibecoding something. All code is generated by GitHub Copilot Agents or with Claude Sonnet 4.5 artifacts (copy-pasted). This is why many things are broken/inaccurate but still got most of what I wanted fairly quickly (<20 minutes) so an interesting experiment nonetheless!
